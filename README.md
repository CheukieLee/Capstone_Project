Title : Analysis of data from survey with Dashboard.

Raw Data : https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/04/09/the-2019-stack-overflow-developer-survey-results-are-in/


Introduction : With data from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019, create dashboards
		in the cloud of IBM Cognos dashboard embedded with Watson Studio.

Purpose : 1. For findings & implications of top 10 Languages and databases between current year
             and next year.
          2. Analysis the trend by three dashboards created as below :
	     Current Technology Usage
	     Future Technology Trend 
	     Demographics Trend
          3. To point out conclusion about implication in future and the outcome by     
             respondents with ages, gender, education level and location.
 
Methodology : Data Collecting
              Data Wrangling
              Data Analysing
              Data Visiualization -Generate Dashboard
              Conclusion - interpreting the result.

Factors and tools to used :
             1. Using descriptive and predictive analytics by bar charts for top 10 Languages between 	        current year and next year to imply any factors existed. 
	     2. Using descriptive and predictive analytics by column charts for top 10 Databases 		between current year and next year to imply any factors existed. 
	     3. Analysis of Current and Future Technology Usage with Platforms and top 10 programming 		language,  databases and webframes by using bar, column, pie charts, word cloud, tree 		map and  hierarchy bubbles for predict the Technology trend in future.
	     4. Analysis of Demographics of respondents with age, gender, education level and 			countries to understand the data resource(survey) by using pie, line, stack bar 		charts and map.

Top 10 PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE TRENDS:
Findings:
Compare with Programming language trends between current and next year:

1. Javascript is top one in programming language trends both years.
2. Sharp increase desire rate of Typescript than that of Javascript.(Typescript rank: 8th up to 4th )
3. Sharp increase desire rate of Python.(Rank: 5th up to 3rd)
4. Decreasing desire trends of most traditional languages(Bash, C++ and Java).

Implications:
1. JavaScript mainly works for web development,  implies that the demand of online services is 
   increasing in market.
2. TypeScript extends JavaScript, usually not challenging from JavaScript to TypeScript. It is so 
   possible that TypeScript would take over Javascript.
3. Not only easy to Learn and Understand, but also has rich libraries for any fields. It will become   
   the main popular programming language in market.
4. It implies that most traditional computer languages would gradually not meet the needs of most
   market.

Top 10 DATABASE TRENDS:
Findings
Compare with databases trend between current and next year:

1. Top one of databases trends from MySQL to PostgeSQL between current and next year.
2. Desired databases trend from structure SQL to NoSQL.
3. 3Desired databases trend from commercial type  to open-source.

Implications
1. It implies that PostgeSQL developers have better prospects due to market needs. 
2. NoSQL databases have become popular than structure databases in main market.
3. It implies that open-source databases would reach the mature level for commercial market use


With Three Dashboard - OVERALL FINDINGS & IMPLICATIONS:
Findings:
1. Javascript is top one in programming language trends both years. Platforms to be used, will be
   stable in future. 
2. Sharp increase desire rate of Typescript than that of Javascript.
3. Data of Survey trends to developed countries, age of 27-29, male gender and high education level
   of Bachelor’s degree.

CONCLUSION:
1. Pure relational Database cannot meet most market need. NoSQL and open-source database will be  
   popular in market.
2. Market trends to manage business in cloud due to sharp increase of web development tools for 
   implement online services. 
3. A new programming language tool is generally rather good fix to current market need.
4. More sample of survey for different countries, gender and age, get more accuracy under normal  
   distribution.
